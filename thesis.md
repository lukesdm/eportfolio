# Master's thesis

The [research group](https://www.plus.ac.at/geoinformatik/research/research-areas/eo-analytics/?lang=en) I've been part of since November 2021 has a project called [Sen2Cube](https://sen2cube.at) - this is a platform offering semantically enriched earth observation data cubes. Per the name, this focuses on Copernicus Sentinel-2 optical data. The *semantic enrichment* takes the form of spectral categories and indices that aim to make performing analyses human-friendly, i.e., convenient, understandable and explainable. My thesis is based on exploring analogous approaches for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. I devised an approach, *Polarimetric categories*, based on radiometric-terrain corrected backscatter amplitudes, and made a Python module for this: [dpolcat](https://github.com/lukesdm/dpolcat). This was presented at the [43rd EARSeL Symposium](https://manchester2024.earsel.org/) in June 2024, in Manchester, UK.
