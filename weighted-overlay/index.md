## Introduction
Scotland, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, offers the right to roam and wild camp across the country's open land (with a few [restrictions][R2R])). This makes it a good place for ad-hoc outdoor adventures.  

But, due to the rugged terrain and uneven ground, especially in the more rural areas, finding suitable camping spots is not always easy. Scotland does however, have the largest forest cover in the UK ([~18%, as of 2019][ForStrat]). Without detailed local knowledge, this makes the hammock the ideal choice for camping.

That said, not all woodland is suitable for hanging a hammock:
* Trees need to be a minimum of 15cm across to avoid damage, so younger woodland is to be avoided.
* A clear 3.5-5m between trees is needed. Coniferous plantations have the highest chance of guaranteeing this. Other forest types may have obstructing undergrowth, or may be too dense.
* A golden rule of hammocking is: Always look up before starting. Unhealthy or old, large-boughed trees and high winds are a dangerous combination.
* Active forestry operations are best avoided.
* Fire risk is also something to consider.

*See also, [Grand Trunk's guide to hammock safety][GTSafety].*

A region around the small, coastal city of Inverness in the Highlands is the focus of this investigation. The area features rolling hills, and encompasses the famous Loch Ness and the Caledonian canal as it meets the North Sea. Weighted overlay analysis is performed using the built-in tools of QGIS.

After all that, there's still usually a place to pitch a tent by the end of the day.

## Method

Given some of the factors discussed earlier, a model for suitable hammock-camping spots can be created. There are some hard requirements that have to be fulfilled, and then preference or desirability can be considered. A final suitability rating of 1 to 5 is assigned.

#### Essential

| Criterion | Rationale
| --- | --- |
| In woodland | It's difficult to hang a hammock otherwise. 
| At least 100m from built-up area | For discretion, and less likely to encroach on enclosed land.
| At most 500m from water | For cooking and cleaning.
| Within 100m of an accessible trail | Trekking through woodland can be difficult.

#### Desirability

| Criterion | Weighting | Rationale
| --- | --- |
| Forest type: Deciduous Broadleaf | 1 | Most likely to have obstructing undergrowth.
| Forest type: Coniferous | 4 | Most likely to have clear distance between trees.
| Forest type: Mixed | 2 | Has characteristics of each of the above.
| Within 5km of a supermarket | 0.5 | Access to supplies, approx. 1hr one-way.
| Within 2.5km of a pub | 0.5 | Access to beer, approx. 1hr round-trip.

#### Not considered

| Criterion | Rationale
| --- | --- |
| Terrain | Most walkable slopes are suitable for a hammock. The region of interest (RoI) doesn't have many unwalkable slopes. 


### Data

#### Trails
The UK has a leading national map provider, [Ordnance Survey][OS]. While there are many datasets offered under an open license, unfortunately the public footpath/hiking trail network is not available. [OpenStreetMap][OSM] (OSM) however, is popular enough in the area that it should be reliable enough for our needs.

The following [Overpass Turbo][OT] query fragment was used to find the walking-accessible (non-private) tracks, from minor roads to footpaths/trails.  

```
type:way AND highway!=motorway AND highway !=trunk AND highway!=primary AND highway!=motorway_link AND highway!=trunk_link AND highway!=primary_link
AND access!=customers AND access!=private AND access!=no
```

#### Pubs and supermarkets
OSM was also queried to find the pubs (`amentity=pub`) and supermarkets (`shop=supermarket`) in the area.


#### Forest/land cover
Again, OSM was consulted for forested areas. However, the woodland type was not always present in the data, and an alternative source had to be found.  

Fortunately in 2021, Space Intelligence with NatureScot released a [land cover dataset][SILandCov] with 20m spatial resolution, discriminating coniferous, deciduous broadleaf, and mixed forest. This also features built-up and inland water, which are useful for the other criteria in our analysis.

*A fully comprehensive source of forestry data was discovered later in the investigation - the Forestry Commission's [National Forest Inventory][ForInv].*
