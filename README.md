# Luke's geoPortfolio Site
This is a Jekyll / Github Pages site.

It uses the [Slate theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate) for regular pages, and a custom theme based on ['Story' by HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/story) for map-based stories.

## local dev

Prerequisites:
* Ruby+DevKit (currently using v2.7.5)
* `gem install bundler`

Build and start dev server:
```
bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If it no longer matches behaviour seen online, try updating dependencies. Also, GitHub Actions may do some extra magic.
