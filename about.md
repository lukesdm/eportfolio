# About
Originally a software developer, a fondness for travel, the outdoors and nature led Luke to studying Geoinformatics at Paris-Lodron-University of Salzburg's [Z_GIS](https://www.plus.ac.at/geoinformatik/?lang=en). Notes from a previous life in electronics and multimedia technology have been dusted off, and are being applied to the field of Earth observation.
